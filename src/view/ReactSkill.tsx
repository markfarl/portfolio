      <h2>Frontend Development & React Ecosystem Experience</h2>
      <p className="mb-5">
        I have extensive experience using <b>React</b> throughout my career, consistently leveraging it to build both <b>complex internal tooling</b> and <b>high‑traffic public‑facing applications</b>. My work spans creating intricate interfaces for manipulating large‑scale data schemas, designing reusable component libraries, and developing components for user tracking and analytics.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-5">
        Alongside React, I have hands‑on experience with other UI frameworks and libraries—<b>AngularJS</b>, <b>Ember</b>, <b>React Native</b>, and <b>Ionic</b>—enabling delivery across both web and mobile platforms. I’m comfortable across the broader JavaScript ecosystem, including state management, styling systems, server‑side rendering, and testing.
