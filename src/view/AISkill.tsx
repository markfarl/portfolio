      <p className="mb-5">I enjoy working with TypeScript on all my JavaScript projects. From simple type definitions to advanced concepts like generics and function types, I use TypeScript to make codebases more reliable, scalable, and easier to maintain.
      </p>
      <p>A well-typed application not only speeds up development but also helps catch issues early—sometimes even removing the need for extra unit tests. This means I can spend less time writing tedious logic checks and more time building features that matter.</p>
      <p className="mb-5">Some projects I’ve worked on recently:</p>
      <ul className="ml-10 list-disc">
        <li>Shutterstock’s public-facing website and its network of subsidiaries</li>
        <li>Internal tools at Shutterstock, built with React and Node.js</li>
        <li>And of course, this portfolio you’re browsing right now! Github link here</li>
